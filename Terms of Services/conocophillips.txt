APPLICABLE LAWS/JURISDICTION


1. By accessing or visiting our websites, you expressly agree that the laws of the State of Texas, excluding its conflicts-of-law rules, shall govern these Terms. Please note that your use of the website may be subject to other local, state, national and international laws. You expressly agree that exclusive jurisdiction for any claim, dispute or cause of action with ConocoPhillips, or relating in any way to your use of the website, resides in the courts of the State of Texas, with venue residing solely in the United States District Court for the Southern District of the State of Texas or a similar Texas state court within Harris County, Texas. You further agree and expressly consent to the exercise of personal jurisdiction in the courts of the State of Texas in connection with any such dispute and including any claim involving ConocoPhillips or its affiliates, subsidiaries, employees, contractors, officers, directors, telecommunication providers and content providers.


2. By accessing or visiting our websites, you expressly waive any and all rights, including those related to privacy, to the extent such rights are different and/or in conflict with those rights protected by federal or Texas laws. We control and operate this website from our offices in the state of Texas in the United States of America. We do not represent that materials on the website are appropriate or available for use in other locations. Persons who choose to access this website from other locations do so on their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable.


3. Except as specifically noted above, no right or license is granted to you under any copyright, patent, trademark or other intellectual property law to use, copy, reproduce, retransmit, display or create derivative works from materials, logos and content contained within this website.


FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS


1. Various pages on this website contain certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are intended to be covered by the safe harbors created thereby. Words such as "expects", "intends", "plans", "projects", "believes", "estimates" and similar expressions are used to identify such forward-looking statements. In addition, certain presentations available for viewing were created as of the dates indicated on such presentations and ConocoPhillips expressly disclaims any responsibility for updating such presentations.


2. Forward-looking statements relating to ConocoPhillips' operations are based on management's expectations, estimates and projections about ConocoPhillips and the petroleum industry in effect on the date the statements were made. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Further, certain forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in such forward-looking statements, due to a variety of factors, including the economic, business, competitive and regulatory factors affecting our business generally as set forth in Item 1A of our Form 10-K and those mentioned in other reports and filings with the Securities Exchange Commission ("SEC"). Copies are available from the SEC and are available on this website.


REGARDING RESERVES


Cautionary Note to U.S. Investors. The SEC permits oil and gas companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose only proved, probable and possible reserves. We may use the term "resource" and other terms on this website in a manner that might otherwise be prohibited in our filings with the SEC, based on SEC guidelines. U.S. investors are urged to consider closely the oil and gas disclosures in our Form 10-K and other reports and filings with the SEC. Copies are available from the SEC and are available on this website.


PRIVACY PLEDGE


ConocoPhillips is committed to honoring the privacy and security of visitors to websites owned and operated by ConocoPhillips or its affiliates. We collect information to process your transactions and to help us provide a better level of service. We do not sell your information to anyone. We strive to protect the security and confidentiality of the information we collect. We urge you to read the following sections.


PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION


1. When you submit a request or electronically pass information to ConocoPhillips (including, but not limited to, completing retail employment applications and credit card applications), you are sometimes asked to provide certain information, including, but not limited to, your name, address, date of birth and email address. In various "contacts" pages, we may ask for personally identifiable information in order to facilitate your requests, provide personalized service and communicate separately with you. We do not sell, trade or rent your personally identifiable information with any third parties outside of ConocoPhillips. However, we may provide your personally identifiable information to a third party that provides services to ConocoPhillips, its affiliates or subsidiaries.


2. Because we rely on third-party commercial software and programs to operate our servers, we may inadvertently collect personal information due to certain automatic functions or features contained in such software or due to certain software changes or upgrades. We will use reasonable efforts to remove any such information after we discover such information in our system.


COOKIES


"Cookies" are pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive to enable you to more easily communicate and interact with a website. We may use cookies to allow you to use our site more easily and to allow us to keep track of certain statistical information that helps us improve our site. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. You may, however, disallow reception of cookies at any time by resetting your Web browser. ConocoPhillips will never use cookies to retrieve information from a computer that is unrelated to the website or your interaction with the website. Our cookies do not contain personally identifiable information.


INTERNET PROTOCOL ADDRESS


We may use your Internet Protocol (IP) address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer the website. Your Internet Protocol address is used to help identify you for the duration of a session and to gather broad demographic information. This information will not be sold to any third party.


CLICK STREAM DATA


As you browse the Internet, a trail of electronic information is left at each website you visit. This information, which is sometimes called "click stream" data, can be collected and stored by a website's server. Click stream data can tell us the type of computer and browsing software you use, the address of the website from which you linked to the website. We may use click stream data to determine how much time visitors spend on each page of the website and how they navigate through the website. We will only use this information to improve the website. Any collection or use of click stream data will be anonymous and aggregate and will not contain any personally identifiable information.


CONSENT TO PROCESSING


By providing any information to the website, all users fully understand and unambiguously consent to the collection and processing of such information in the United States.


LEGAL DISCLOSURE


ConocoPhillips shall, pursuant to valid legal process, such as a search warrant, subpoena or court order, allow access to information, including personally identifiable information, provided to the website in order to comply with such process and to protect its rights and property.


LINKED SITES


The website may contain links to other sites. Other sites may also reference or link to the website. ConocoPhillips is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such other sites.


PARENTAL CONSENT


Our website may contain pages that are of interest to children under the age of 18, but we do not seek through this site to gather personal information specifically from or about children under 18. Because our software does not automatically distinguish visitors under 18 from other visitors, ConocoPhillips requires users younger than 18 years of age to obtain the consent of a parent, guardian, teacher or librarian to view the website. You agree to abide by such restrictions and not to help anyone avoid these restrictions.


CHILDREN


The website is not directed nor targeted to children. ConocoPhillips will not knowingly collect information from children. Because our software does not automatically distinguish visitors younger than 18 from other visitors, ConocoPhillips requires users younger than 18 years of age to obtain the consent of a parent, guardian, teacher or librarian to view the website. If ConocoPhillips learns that a child has provided personally identifiable information to the website, it will use reasonable efforts to remove such information from its files.


USER'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS POLICY


By visiting the website, you signify your assent to the terms of ConocoPhillips' privacy policy. If you do not agree with the terms of this privacy policy, please do not use the website. We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change, modify, add or remove portions from this privacy policy at any time. Your continued use of the website following the posting of changes to these terms means you accept these changes.
